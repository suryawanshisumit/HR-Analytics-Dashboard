📊 HR Analytics: Employee Attrition & Performance Dashboard
1. Project Title / Headline
HR Analytics Dashboard A data-driven human resources tool designed to monitor workforce health, analyze employee turnover drivers, and optimize talent management through actionable real-time insights.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The HR Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report developed to provide HR leaders and department heads with a 360-degree view of the organization’s headcount. It enables the identification of patterns in employee attrition, tracks diversity and inclusion, and evaluates the correlation between compensation and performance.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform used for data visualization and report design.

📂 Power Query – Utilized for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean HR records and handle missing values.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create measures such as Attrition Rate, Average Tenure, and Employee Satisfaction scores.

📝 Data Modeling – Structured a star schema connecting employee profiles, performance reviews, and department hierarchies.

4. Data Source
Source: Synthetic/Internal HR Information System (HRIS) Dataset.

Data Structure: Includes demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status), Job Details (Department, Job Role, Years at Company), and Satisfaction Metrics (Job Involvement, Environment Satisfaction).

5. Features / Highlights
Business Problem High employee turnover is costly and disruptive. HR departments often struggle to pinpoint why top performers leave or which departments have the lowest engagement levels, leading to reactive rather than proactive talent management.

Goal of the Dashboard

To visualize the current organizational landscape and identify attrition hotspots.

To provide deep-dive filtering by department, education level, and job role.

To identify key factors (like distance from home or monthly income) that lead to employee exits.
